My research focuses on understanding interactions and feedbacks between regional and global climates, climate change, and agricultural land and resource use. To understand these interactions, I utilize a variety of tools and datasets, including global climate models, emerging agricultural landuse data products, and process-based crop models. With my global network of interdisciplinary collaborators, I have undertaken numerous climate-agroecosystem studies that range from quantifying the effects of agricultural land management on regional climate systems to bracketing climate change impacts on small-holder livelihoods. While my work is situated in a global context, I maintain a particular emphasis on the semi-arid tropics -- a vast, highly-populated and rapidly-developing domain that is acutely vulnerable to global environmental change.     
My projects are generally grouped by the following core questions:

1) How does agricultural land management  disturb regional climates and natural ecosystems to drive environmental change?

2) How does climate change impact agricultural production, particularly in vulnerable regions?

3) How can we grow nutritious food that is resilient to change and non-disruptive to regional and global environments?

4) ADD MISSING Q
