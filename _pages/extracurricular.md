## CLIMATE AND THE ARTS

Superhero Clubhouse - Eco-theater to enact climate and environmental justice, cultivate hope, and inspire a thriving future. I have served as a Core Member since 2019.

Jump!Star Art Initiative - Supported by the National Endowment for the Arts “Our Town” grant and organizational partners in several cities, Jump!Star been hosting a series of themed dream-storming sessions called “Constellates,” which focus on the changing North Star as a way to engage in thinking deeply about the future and creating cultural customs (songs, dances, food, regalia, ritual objects) to welcome it. I have served as a consulting scientist on climate and agriculture: http://www.jumpstar.love/satellites.

The Arctic Cycle - The Arctic Cycle uses storytelling and live performance to foster dialogue about our global climate crisis, create an empowering vision of the future, and inspire people to take action. I have participated and given guest lectures in Arctic Cycle incubators and partner initiatives: https://artsandclimate.org/incubator-nyc-2024

The Green Rooms - NAC English Theatre in partnership with many others brought together participants for an extraordinary three-day/three-country digital experiment that reflected on the future of theatre. The Green Rooms were fueled with spirited conversations with leaders in fields such as climate activism, ecological economy and environmental humanities, as well as with theatre artists and leaders who have found innovative ways to engage with the climate crisis. I served on the Curatorial Team.
