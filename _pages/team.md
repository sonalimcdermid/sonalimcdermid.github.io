I am a climate scientist and Associate Professor of Environmental Studies at NYU. My research explores the role of landscapes in our regional and global climate systems. In particular, I focus on agriculture as both a driver of global environmental change and vulnerable to it. Global agriculture must feed >9 billion people by 2050 without exceeding a “safe operating space” within the ecosystems that support it. Climate change, partly driven by agriculture itself, further complicates this endeavor.  I use a variety of tools in my research, including process-based climate models, crop models, and a range of observational and remote-sensing datasets. I am also a research affiliate at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), where I help develop the land surface component of the NASA GISS ModelE climate model for improved agricultural representation. I have also been recently awarded Fulbright-Kalam Fellowship (2020) and an Andrew Carnegie Scholar Fellowship (2021) to study modes for climate-smart rice production. During the past 10 years, I served as the Climate Co-Lead for the <a href="https://www.agmip.org/">Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project</a>, a UKAID project investigating the impact of climate change on food security across South Asia and Africa. 

### Education

I hold a B.A. in Physics from NYU (2006), and an M.A. (2008), M.Phil. (2011), and Ph.D. (2012) from the Dept. of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Columbia University, specializing in Atmospheric and Climate Science. Prior to my appointment NYU, I was NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at NASA GISS in NYC.
